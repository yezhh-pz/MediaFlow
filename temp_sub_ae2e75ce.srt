1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
But I do think there's something to be said.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,100
You have the option for selling stuff that's good

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,880
for people instead of stuff that tricks them.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,680
And at any rate, that's our approach.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,860
And I would choose that approach even if I made less money.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,200
I, in fact, think you make more.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,160
It reminds me of Warren Buffett's favorite saying.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,520
You should always take the high road as it's less crowded.

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,140
And that's the system.
